# CrownFall

# Overview

After a tragic accident, the kingdom’s magical energy core exploded.
The resulting blast shattered the realm and hurled its fragments into the sky, where they now remain suspended in time.

CrownFall was developed as a learning project within three weeks (June 17 - July 10).
It tells the symbolic story of a fallen king striving to reclaim what was lost — both his world and his strength.
